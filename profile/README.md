# Soundscape Community

Soundscape Community (briefly known as Openscape) seeks to continue the work on Soundscape, the open sourced navigation and way finding app from Microsoft Research.

## Contributing

All help is welcome. Besides developing the iOS app itself, there is a need for translators, people who can help set up and manage infrastructure, people with experience in setting up open source communities, etc. If you see something where you could help out, please comment on or open an issue in the appropriate repository.

## Getting in touch

The community has a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2UCc9yHmRh) for general chat, discussion, questions and tester feedback.
